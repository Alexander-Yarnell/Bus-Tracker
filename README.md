# Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a mapbox based project using asyncronis code to connect to an api fetching the location of Busses in Boston Massachussets. This web app shows the user the location and cappacity of each bus being tracked. As well as every bus stop between MIT, and Harvard. 

To run this project you will need a mapbox account and and map access token, aswell as a way to host the page. (I use XAMPP Control panel)
Extract the zip and open the file provided in your prefered text editor. (I use VS Code)
Navigate to the script.js file and at the very top add your token to the "mapboxgl.accessToken" variable; 
Next just open the index.html file in any browser. (I use Chrome)

##Future Roadmap
The next steps for this app include.
Adding bus routes and scheduels for each bus route.
Improving the ( UI ) User Interface of the app.
Incorperating google maps to show trafic to get a more realistic ETA ( Estimated Time of Arrival ).
